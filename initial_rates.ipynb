    "It is not possible to directly measure the instantaneous (differential) rate at a moment $t'$, $\\frac{d[A]}{dt}\\Bigr|_{\\substack{t=t'}}$. We can measure the change in concentration over a finite period of time $\\Delta t$ and use it to approximate the instantaneous rate at any particular moment $t'$ within the time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, the concentration of the species $A$, $[A]$, is measured a certain number of times from $t=0$ to $t=t'$. From these measurements, the instantaneous rate $\\frac{d[A]}{dt}\\Bigr|_{\\substack{t=0}}$ can be estimated and then related to $v(0)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "<center>$v(0) = -\\frac{1}{\\nu_{A}}\\frac{d[A]}{dt}\\Bigr|_{\\substack{t=0}} = k[A]_{0}^{m_{A}}[B]_{0}^{m_{B}}$</center><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The *initial* rate, $v(0)$, is studied because the concentrations of each of the chemical species are known at $t=0$. At that instant, $[A]$ is $[A]_{0}$ and $[B]$ is $[B]_{0}$. If no product is present at $t=0$, a reverse reaction will not affect the measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider then two experiments carried out to determine $k$, $m_{A}$ and $m_{B}$. The initial concentration of $A$ is the same in both experiments, while the initial concentration of $B$ is varied. The rates of reaction for these two sets of initial conditions are given by \n",
    "\n",
    "<center>$v(0)_{1} = -\\frac{1}{\\nu_{A}}\\Bigr(\\frac{d[A]}{dt}\\Bigr|_{\\substack{t=0}}\\Bigr)_{1} = k[A]_{0}^{m_{A}}([B]_{0})_{1}^{m_{B}}$</center><br/>\n",

    "\n",
    "Because $\\nu_{A}$, $k$, $[A]_{0}$, ${m_{A}}$ and $m_{B}$ are the same across the two different measurements, one can use the ratio of the initial rates to solve for $m_{B}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>$m_{B} = \\frac{\\ln{\\frac{v(0)_{1}}{v(0)_{2}}}}{\\ln{\\frac{([B]_{0})_{1}}{([B]_{0})_{2}}}}$</center><br/>\n",

    "3. The method is not appropriate to study *fast* reactions. That is, if the time required to mix the reactants is long compared with the reaction process itself, the rate law cannot be determined using this method."
