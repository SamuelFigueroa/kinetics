Chemical Kinetics in Jupyter Lab
==========================

A small set of Python functions created in Jupyter Lab to:
* Estimate rate laws by the initial rates method.
* Determine the concentrations of components in a mixture by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and Full-Spectrum Quantitation (FSQ).

## Usage
* Clone this repository.
* Each Jupyter Lab notebook has an auto-generated .py file so users can import functions from the package into their code. For example:

```
from kinetics.initial_rates import compInitialRate
```

* The Jupyter Lab notebooks contain the documented functions alongside a theoretical background and a step-by-step method of computation.
