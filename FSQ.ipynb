    "#### I. Beer's law\n",
    "\n",
    "The relation between the concentration of an absorbing analyte and the measured absorbance $A$ or transmittance $T$ of solutions contained in transparent cells that have a path length of $b$ centimeters is described by Beer's law:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>$A = -\\log{T} = \\log{\\frac{P_{0}}{P}} = \\epsilon b c$</center>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P_{0}$ is the radiant power in watts incident on the sample and $P$ is the radiant power transmitted by the sample, $\\epsilon$ is the molar absorptivity, and $c$ is the concentration of the absorbing substance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mixture containing more than one absorbing substance, i.e. a multicomponent absorbing system, will exhibit a total absorbance,\n",

    "1. Beer's law only applies to mixtures of non-interacting species.\n",
    "2. Significant deviations from the direct (linear) proportionality expressed by the law are often observed under the following conditions:\n",
    "    * At high analyte concentrations, usually above $0.01 M$, solute-solvent and solute-solute interactions, or hydrogen bonding can affect the analyte absorptivity. \n",
    "    * At low analyte concentrations but high concentrations of another species, particularly electrolytes.\n",
    "    * When changes in the analyte concentration significantly alters the refractive index $n$ of the solution.\n",
    "    <center>$A_{observed} = \\frac{n}{(n^2+2)^2}\\epsilon bc$</center>\n",
    "    <br/>\n",
    "    * When the analyte associates, dissociates or reacts with the solvent (e.g., an unbuffered solution of a species affected by an acid-base equilibrium) resulting in a multicomponent absorbing system.\n",
    "    <center>$A_{observed} = A_{1} + A_{2} + \\dots + A_{n}$</center>\n",
    "    <br/>\n",
    "    * When polychromatic source radiation is employed to make absorbance measurements and the molar absorptivity of the analyte is not constant across the wavelengths considered.\n",

    "    <center>$A_{observed} = \n",
    "    \\log{\n",

    "    $</center>\n",
    "    <br/>\n",
    "    * When stray radiation is present inside the instrument used to measure absorbance.\n",
    "    <center>$A_{observed} = \\log{\\frac{P_{0} + P_{stray}}{P + P_{stray}}}$</center>\n",
    "    <br/>\n",
    "    * When the cells holding the analyte and blank solutions are not of equal path length and equivalent optical characteristics.\n",
    "    <center>$A_{observed} = \\epsilon b c + k$</center>\n",
    "    <br/>\n",
